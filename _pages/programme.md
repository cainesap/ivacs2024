### 0930 - Keynote 1, Plenary room

Dr Brian Clancy, Mary Immaculate College, Ireland

![Portrait picture of Dr Brian Clancy, Mary Immaculate College, Ireland](brian.jpg)

_Bio_: Brian Clancy is a lecturer in applied linguistics at Mary Immaculate College, Ireland. His
research work focusses on the blend of a corpus linguistic methodology with the
discourse analytic approaches of pragmatics and sociolinguistics. His primary
methodological interests relate to the use of corpora in the study of language varieties
and the construction and analysis of small corpora. His published work explores
language use in intimate settings, such as between family and close friends, and the
language variety Irish English. He is author of _Investigating Intimate Discourse:
Exploring the spoken interaction of families, couples and close friends_ (Routledge, 2016)
and co-author, with Anne O’Keeffe and Svenja Adolphs, of _Introducing Pragmatics in Use_
(Routledge, 2011 and 2020).

_Title_: **A Many-Splendored Thing: (Corpus) Perspectives on Intimate Discourse**

_Abstract_: This paper takes a pluralistic, corpus approach to explorations of intimate discourse. Intimate
discourse, that is to say the conversation between couples, family and close friends, is an
integral part of our lives and everyday spoken world. Much of the initial literature on intimacy
explored what might be referred to as ‘established intimacy’, with a focus on parents with
children or friends that lived in shared accommodation over a long period of time (see Clancy,
2016). One of the reasons for the privileging of these sites was the issue of the accessibility of
the context, which meant that much of the data collection was, by necessity, opportunistic.
However, alongside today’s growing proliferation of data in the public domain, and more
openness to seeing the potential in different types of linguistic data, there are more routes to
intimate discourse than ever before. This has allowed researchers to continue their focus on
established intimacy, while also investigating what we can term ‘nascent intimacy’, such as
initial encounters (see, for example, Haugh and Sinkeviciute, 2021), and indeed, initial romantic
encounters. Using a comparative corpus approach that primarily utilises first-generation
concordancing tools such as keyword lists and concordance lines, and a range of small corpora
collected to represent spoken Irish English, this paper seeks to marry findings from both
established and nascent intimacy in order to determine how they might inform and
complement one another. In doing so, it argues for the value of applied corpus approaches, a
‘first principles’ orientation to seeing into datasets, and how intimate discourse, the delicate
calibration of language that is core to our interpersonal relationships, should be highlighted and
valorised.

### 0930 - Keynote 2, Plenary room

Dr Geraldine Mark, Cardiff University, U.K.

![Portrait picture of Dr Geraldine Mark, Cardiff University, U.K.](geraldine.jpg)

_Bio_: Geraldine Mark is a corpus linguist whose interests include language development, data-driven learning, and discourse analysis. Most recently she has been working on a multi-modal corpus project, IVO (www.ivohub.com), examining multi-modal interaction in the virtual workplace. She is a Visiting Lecturer at the University of Malta, and advises on the FoRCE project, building and analysing a corpus of Maltese English. She is co-author of _English Grammar Today_ (2011, Cambridge University Press, with Ronald Carter, Michael McCarthy and Anne O’Keeffe) and co-principal researcher (with Anne O’Keeffe) of the _English Grammar Profile_, an online resource profiling L2 grammar development.

_Title_: **Shall I compare thee to the BNC?**

_Abstract_: Comparison is a cornerstone of corpus linguistics. Comparisons can be superficially simple,
but a scratch below the surface typically reveals complexity, when variation between corpora
and within corpora is not always obvious, and where “there is little understanding of what
constitutes a small or large difference between corpora” (Gablasova et al. 2017). This talk is
a personal reflection on some of the pitfalls and affordances encountered when comparing
one corpus with another, particularly in relation to learner language. I draw on three case
studies, firstly using the Cambridge Learner Corpus* to look at development in writing across
the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) proficiency levels, secondly
contrasting adverb use in spoken language from the LINDSEI and LOCNEC corpora†, and
finally exploring the design and development of a corpus of spoken and written Maltese
English. I touch on measures of language development in terms of quality and time (Durrant
et al. 2021), the use norms and attitudes to variation within learner corpus research, and
consider implications for corpus design and representativeness.

\* The Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) is a corpus of written exam data from Cambridge English exams. The
data used for this study stands at 55.5 million words and comprises 266,600 exam documents of open-ended
writing, spanning 143 different first languages backgrounds, six proficiency levels, from a 17-year period
(1993–2012).
