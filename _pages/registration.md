## Social events

The **conference dinner** will be held at Robinson College on the evening of Tuesday 16th July, with 3 courses for 50 GBP per person (excluding drinks).

We would also like to gauge interest in **Cambridge tours** (punting or a walking tour): there is no charge for these at present, but you can tick a box when you register so that we get an indication of the level of interest.


## Presenter instructions

If presenting a paper at IVACS 2024, you can update your abstract on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=IVACS/2024/Conference/Authors).
We encourage you to do so based on the reviews you received and any further work you have done.
You will be able to edit your abstracts until 8th July 2024, 23:59 Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12).

**Talk slots** will involve a 15-minute presentation, plus 5 minutes for questions and discussion.
We'll contact you nearer the time with a timeslot for your talk, and a link to a shared folder where we'll ask you to upload your presentation slides.

**Poster presentations** should be in portrait orientation, size A1 or A0. 
There are poster printing facilities in Cambridge: for instance the [Reprographics Centre](https://www.em.admin.cam.ac.uk/what-we-do/estate-operations/facilities-services/reprographics/about-us) in the city centre. If you are going to use this kind of option, we recommend contacting them and sending your file well ahead of the date. Please get in touch with us if you have any queries.
